# Hi, I'm Matteo and I am an ecologist.
<br>
## I study how organisms interact with their environment to shape the world around them. Welcome to my website!

My research focuses on how energy, matter, and information shape the relationships between living beings and their environment. I work to expand models of ecosystem functioning, using a mix of empirical and theoretical studies. I do this by measuring exchanges of matter, energy, and information between organisms and their environment, and developing new theoretical models to predict how ecosystems change as a result. My goal is to expand our knowledge of ecosystem functioning, to improve how we predict and mitigate the impact of human activities on our planet.
