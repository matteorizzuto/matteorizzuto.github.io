Ecosystems are one of the basic units of ecology: combinations of organisms and inorganic environmental features that interact at multiple spatial and temporal scales. A forest on the side of a mountain, a tree in that forest, or a leaf on that tree are all examples of ecosystems. Despite their obvious differences in size, each comprises _trophic interactions_ and _exchanges of materials_ with their surroundings. In a _trophic interaction_ a consumer---e.g., a plant, an animal, a bacteria---consumes a resource, for instance, nutrients in the soil or another organism, to obtain energy, grow, and eventually reproduce. _Exchanges of materials_ with the ecosystem’s surroundings comprise mobilising and transporting matter, energy, and information in time and space. Trophic interactions within ecosystems and cross-ecosystem exchanges weave a network that spans the globe, supporting life everywhere.

My work focuses on investigating and understanding how cross-ecosystem exchanges modify the dynamics of ecosystems over time. I am also interested in how ecosystem characteristics---for instance, resource distribution in space and time---change the way organisms use their environment.
