title: "Ecology of Ecosystems"
excerpt: "<p><img style='float: right;border: 2px solid #555;' width='400' height='250' hspace='2' vspace='2' src='../images/RoadMap_Ecosystems.pdf'/>Organisms, of course, are not isolated from their enviroment, nor are they just receivers of environmental inputs. They actively influence the environment they live in, shaping it in myriad ways. Identity, condition, activity, density, and diversity of the organisms living in an environment are but a few of the biological factors that can change the non-living world—and in turn be changed by it. This theme made up a substantial portion of my doctoral research and is still a major component of my work. In particular, I am interested in the zoogeochemistry of organisms and how it influences ecosystem structure and functions. </p>"

Ecosystems are one of the basic units of ecology: combinations of organisms and inorganic environmental features that interact at multiple spatial and temporal scales. A forest on the side of a mountain, a tree in that forest, or a leaf on that tree are all examples of ecosystems. Despite their obvious differences in size, each comprises _trophic interactions_ and _exchanges of materials_ with their surroundings. In a _trophic interaction_ a consumer---e.g., a plant, an animal, a bacteria---consumes a resource, for instance, nutrients in the soil or another organism, to obtain energy, grow, and eventually reproduce. _Exchanges of materials_ with the ecosystem’s surroundings comprise mobilising and transporting matter, energy, and information in time and space. Trophic interactions within ecosystems and cross-ecosystem exchanges weave a network that spans the globe, supporting life everywhere.

My work focuses on investigating and understanding how cross-ecosystem exchanges modify the dynamics of ecosystems over time. I am also interested in how ecosystem characteristics---for instance, resource distribution in space and time---change the way organisms use their environment.
